##Algorithm
This code will execute fore responding with match from friends list:
```javascript
//friends is the api/friends rout
var answers = [q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6,q7,q8,q9,q10];
        var matchingscores = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];
        for (var i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {                      
            for(var n = 0; n<10; n++){
                if(friends[i].scores[n]==answers[n]){
                    matchingscores[i]++;
                }   
                }
        }

        HighestMatchingIndex = 0;
        for(var i=0; i<9; i++){

            if(matchingscores[HighestMatchingIndex] > Number(matchingscores[i])){

            }else{
                HighestMatchingIndex = i;
            }
        }

        res.json(friends[HighestMatchingIndex]);
```

The friends.js which contains the _friends_ in above code:

```javascript
var friends = [
